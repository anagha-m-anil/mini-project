# Vehicle Accident Prevention, Detection & Reporting System

This project is an Arduino-based embedded system that detects accidents using sensors and automatically sends GPS location alerts to emergency contacts.

## Features
- Alcohol detection using MQ3 sensor
- Drowsiness detection via eye blink sensor
- Crash detection using ADXL335 accelerometer
- GPS tracking (Neo6M)
- GSM alert system (SIM800L)

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno R3
- MQ3 sensor
- Eye Blink sensor
- ADXL335 accelerometer
- Neo6M GPS Module
- SIM800L GSM Module

# How It Works

1. Upon power-up, the system initializes all sensors.
2. Alcohol and drowsiness levels are continuously monitored.
3. If alcohol is detected, the ignition system is locked (simulated in prototype).
4. If drowsiness is detected, a buzzer alert is triggered.
5. In case of a crash, GPS location is fetched and an SMS is sent using the GSM module.
6. All status updates can be optionally displayed on an LCD screen or through the serial monitor.
